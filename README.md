# aNEOS: Artificial Near Earth Object detection System

## A Scientific Platform for Detecting Engineered Celestial Objects

aNEOS is a sophisticated, multi-component platform that advances the groundbreaking **Artificial NEOs Theory** through rigorous astronomical data processing and machine learning-based anomaly detection. Building upon the foundational research from the [neo-analyzer-repo](https://github.com/RobLe3/neo-analyzer-repo), this system represents the next evolution in the search for potentially engineered celestial objects.

## The Artificial NEOs Theory - Scientific Foundation

### Core Hypothesis

The Artificial NEOs Theory suggests that some Near-Earth Objects might exhibit orbital behaviors indicating external intervention by an advanced intelligence. This paradigm-shifting approach challenges conventional astrophysics by proposing that certain celestial bodies could be:

- **Covert Observation Platforms**: Modified asteroids used for Earth monitoring and reconnaissance
- **Surveillance Infrastructure**: Long-term data collection systems disguised as natural objects  
- **Evidence of Intelligence**: Proof of advanced civilization with deep-space operational capability

### Scientific Rationale

If an advanced civilization wanted to monitor Earth covertly, modifying existing NEO orbits would be optimal because such objects would:

1. **Blend Seamlessly**: Indistinguishable from natural space debris
2. **Maintain Stability**: Predictable return cycles for periodic data collection
3. **Require Minimal Energy**: Long-term operation with subtle orbital adjustments
4. **Avoid Detection**: No obvious artificial signatures unlike conventional satellites

### Evolution from Original Research

This system builds directly on the pioneering work in [neo-analyzer-repo](https://github.com/RobLe3/neo-analyzer-repo), which established the theoretical framework with scripts like `neos_o3high_v6.16.py` and `reporting_neos_ng_v3.0.py`. aNEOS represents a complete architectural evolution, providing:
