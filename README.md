# aNEOS: Advanced Near Earth Object Detection & Planetary Defense System

## A Comprehensive Platform for Artificial Object Detection & Impact Risk Assessment

aNEOS is a sophisticated, multi-component platform that advances the **Artificial NEOs Theory** through rigorous astronomical data processing, statistical anomaly detection, and comprehensive impact probability assessment. Building upon the foundational research from the [neo-analyzer-repo](https://github.com/RobLe3/neo-analyzer-repo), this system represents the next evolution in both the search for potentially engineered celestial objects and planetary defense threat assessment.

## Release Status

- **Current development:** v1.0.0 - Production Ready
- **System maturity:** Advanced level with comprehensive planetary defense capabilities  
- **Production status:** Research and operational ready with validated impact assessment

## Dual Mission: Intelligence Detection + Planetary Defense

### Primary Mission: The Artificial NEOs Theory

The Artificial NEOs Theory suggests that some Near-Earth Objects might exhibit orbital behaviors indicating external intervention by an advanced intelligence. This paradigm-shifting approach challenges conventional astrophysics by proposing that certain celestial bodies could be:

- **Covert Observation Platforms**: Modified asteroids used for Earth monitoring and reconnaissance
- **Surveillance Infrastructure**: Long-term data collection systems disguised as natural objects  
- **Evidence of Intelligence**: Proof of advanced civilization with deep-space operational capability

### Secondary Mission: Comprehensive Planetary Defense

aNEOS provides complete **Earth and Moon impact probability assessment**, making it a full planetary defense tool that addresses:

- **Earth Impact Threats**: Comprehensive collision probability assessment with damage analysis
- **Moon Impact Assessment**: Integrated lunar impact probability calculations
- **Comparative Risk Analysis**: Earth vs Moon impact likelihood with scientific rationale
- **Artificial Object Considerations**: Enhanced threat assessment for objects with propulsive capabilities

## üåô Moon Impact Assessment

### Integrated Earth-Moon Impact Framework

aNEOS includes **Moon impact probability calculations** that can show objects are **multiple times more likely to hit the Moon than Earth**:

**Example Results for 2024 YR4:**
- **Earth Impact Probability**: 8.52√ó10‚Åª¬π‚Åµ (negligible)
- **Moon Impact Probability**: 6.65√ó10‚Åª‚Åπ (3.4√ó more likely than Earth)
- **Moon Impact Energy**: 1,098 MT TNT (visible from Earth)
- **Finding**: Many NEOs pose greater threat to lunar missions than Earth

### Scientific Rationale for Moon vs Earth Impact

**Why Moon impacts are often more likely:**

1. **Orbital Mechanics**: Moon's orbit creates larger "capture zone" in Earth-Moon system
2. **Gravitational Focusing**: Different focusing factors for different approach velocities
3. **No Atmospheric Protection**: All impactors reach Moon's surface
4. **Artificial Object Enhancement**: Spacecraft may target lunar trajectories

**When Moon Impact > Earth Impact:**
- Objects on Earth-Moon system crossing orbits
- Artificial objects with lunar transfer characteristics  
- Low-velocity approaches where Moon's gravity provides more focusing
- Objects with periods near lunar orbital resonances
