# aNEOS Development Roadmap
**Advanced Near Earth Object detection System**

This document outlines the completed development phases and future enhancements for the aNEOS platform, building upon the foundational work from the [neo-analyzer-repo](https://github.com/RobLe3/neo-analyzer-repo).

## ‚úÖ Stabilized Phases (August 2025)

### Phase 1: Core System Foundation ‚úÖ
- **‚úÖ Installation System**: Comprehensive installer with dependency management (`install.py`)
- **‚úÖ Project Architecture**: Modular structure with `aneos_core/`, `aneos_api/`, and organized directories
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Robust `@safe_execute` decorator and graceful error recovery
- **‚úÖ Security**: Custom-generated API keys for each installation, no hardcoded secrets

### Phase 2: NEO Analysis Engine ‚úÖ
- **‚úÖ Simple NEO Analyzer**: Basic artificial signature detection (`simple_neo_analyzer.py`)
- **‚úÖ Enhanced NEO Poller**: Multi-source data enrichment with TAS scoring (`enhanced_neo_poller.py`)
- **‚úÖ Data Quality System**: 100% completeness validation before analysis
- **‚úÖ Professional Reporting**: Academic-quality output with AI validation

### Phase 3: System Integration ‚úÖ  
- **‚úÖ Interactive Menu System**: 25+ features across 6 categories (`aneos_menu.py`)
- **‚úÖ Command-Line Interface**: Streamlined CLI with help system (`aneos.py`)
- **‚úÖ API Services**: 52 functional endpoints with authentication (`aneos_api/`)
- **‚úÖ Database Integration**: SQLite with 7 tables, SQLAlchemy 2.0+ compatibility

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ‚úÖ
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing**: 100% basic menu feature validation
- **‚úÖ System Health Monitoring**: Complete status checks and diagnostics
- **‚úÖ Import Resolution**: Fixed NumPy 2.x compatibility and authentication issues
- **‚úÖ End-to-End Validation**: All core functionality operational

## üéØ Current Status: Stabilization In Progress

**System State**: Core flows operate in development, but real-data polling still
leans on mock fallbacks when optional integrations are absent.
**Test Coverage**: 61 automated tests cover cache, configuration, detection,
and integration harnesses; further operational drills are planned.
**Documentation**: Installation and quick-start guides exist, yet several
sections still overstate production readiness and need revision.
**Stability**: Critical regressions from the 0.7 upgrade have been mitigated,
while external dependency monitoring and sigma-5 validation remain on the
roadmap.

**Evolution from neo-analyzer-repo**: This roadmap traces the path from the
foundational theoretical work toward an operationally verified sigma-5
detection platform. Additional hardening is required before claiming full
production readiness.

**Next Review**: After integration health checks and end-to-end sigma-5
validations are documented.
