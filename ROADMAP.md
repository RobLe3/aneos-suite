# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned future developments for the NEO Analyzer & Reporting Tools, focusing on the scientific methodology for detecting artificial NEOs and refining our anomaly detection framework.

## Short-Term Goals
- **Code Refactoring:**  
  Refine and modularize code for easier maintenance and contribution.
- **Enhanced Documentation:**  
  Improve inline comments and add more detailed usage examples, ensuring clarity for scientific analysis.
- **Testing Suite:**  
  Develop unit and integration tests for key functions in the analysis and reporting scripts, ensuring repeatable and verifiable results.
- **Refinement of TAS (Total Anomaly Score) Calculation:**  
  Improve statistical models to enhance detection accuracy of artificially influenced NEOs.

## Mid-Term Goals
- **Data Integration:**  
  Incorporate additional NEO data sources (NASA, ESA, and other minor planet databases) to improve cross-referencing and anomaly detection.
- **Advanced Visualization Enhancements:**  
  Upgrade graphical outputs (2D/3D plots, heatmaps) for better clarity in highlighting outliers and anomalous NEO behaviors.
- **Expanded Feature Set for `neos_o3high_v6.16.py` and `reporting_neos_ng_v3.0.py`:**  
  Implement deeper anomaly classification and add historical comparison capabilities to track long-term behavioral deviations.
- **User Interface:**  
  Develop a lightweight GUI to enable non-programmers to access and utilize analysis results effectively.

## Long-Term Goals
- **Collaborative Expansion:**  
  Establish a framework for community-driven enhancements, peer review, and cross-validation of findings by independent researchers.
- **Research Publications:**  
  Use the toolset to support rigorous scientific studies on the potential artificial nature of certain NEOs and contribute to peer-reviewed journals.
- **Integration with External Systems:**  
  Develop APIs for real-time data sharing with astronomical databases, observation networks, and potential SETI collaborations.
- **Machine Learning Integration:**  
  Apply ML models to refine anomaly detection and predictive analytics based on historical NEO behaviors.
