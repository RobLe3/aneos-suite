- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- Ensure any new code includes appropriate documentation and testing.
- When modifying analysis logic, update both code comments and documentation in the `README.md`.
- Contributions should maintain the integrity of the anomaly detection methodology outlined in the `neos_o3high_v6.16.py` and `reporting_neos_ng_v3.0.py` scripts.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, please open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker. Provide as much detail as possible so that we can reproduce the problem or understand your suggestion.

If your issue relates to the detection of artificial NEOs, please include:
- A description of the anomaly.
- Relevant data sources or evidence.
- Suggested improvements to analysis methodology.
