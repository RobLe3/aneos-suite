# aNEOS v0.7.0 Release Notes

## Overview
The 0.7 stabilization release aligns the active development line with the current
codebase while preserving the previous functionality snapshot on the
`version/0.5` branch. This lets teams continue referencing the legacy behaviour
while new work iterates on the modernized configuration, caching, and detection
pipelines.

## Highlights
- **Version alignment** – All public packages now expose `__version__ = "0.7.0"`
  so API consumers, dashboards, and downstream tooling report the same release
  identifier.
- **Legacy preservation** – The `version/0.5` Git branch tracks the exact
  predecessor of this release for long-term support or regression comparison.
- **Documentation** – The project changelog and release notes now describe the
  version transition and reference the legacy branch for clarity.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Update your deployments or integrations to expect version `0.7.0` when
   interrogating aNEOS packages.
2. If you rely on the historical 0.5 behaviour, pin to the `version/0.5` branch
   or tag before pulling the latest changes.
3. No database schema or API contract changes are introduced in this release;
   refreshing code dependencies is sufficient.

## Verification
The release has been validated by ensuring the package metadata exposes the
correct version identifiers and that the changelog reflects the new release.
Additional functional or regression testing should be run per your operational
requirements.
